                If a teacher intends to stop classes for any reason, they must
                provide at least 15 days' prior notice to Add-Ins Education.
                Failure to do so will result in the withholding of the teacher's
                salary for the period not in compliance with the terms and
                conditions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2">
                In cases of medical emergencies or urgent situations, teachers
                must submit relevant legal documents, such as medical
                certificates, to Add-Ins Education for verification. Upon
                confirmation, the pending salary will be released accordingly.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2">
                Parents who wish to terminate classes mid-session must provide
                at least one week's notice to Add-Ins Education.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2">
                In the event of a conflict between the teacher and client,
                immediate termination of classes will only be permitted if both
                parties mutually agree. Payments will be calculated up to the
                last class attended, and the teacher will be compensated
                accordingly. Please note that charges or payments will only
                apply to classes taken, and the full month's amount will not be
                charged to parents or paid to teachers under any circumstances.

                While we do not restrict teachers from answering urgent or
                emergency calls, this must be done outside the teaching area to
                minimize disruption.

                genuine cases of urgency or emergency.
